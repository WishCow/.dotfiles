Name
====

autocomplete-ALL-the-things - an urxvt plugin allowing user to easily complete arbitrary text

Installation
------------

Copy the `autocomplete-ALL-the-things` file to the urxvt perl-lib directory
(default: `~/.urxvt/ext/`).

Add the following lines to your `~/.Xresources` (or `~/.Xdefaults`):

```
URxvt.perl-ext-common:    ...,autocomplete-ALL-the-things
URxvt.keysym.M-C-slash:   perl:aAtt:word-complete
URxvt.keysym.M-question:  perl:aAtt:fuzzy-complete
URxvt.keysym.M-quotedbl:  perl:aAtt:undo
```

Description
-----------

Completes the currently typed word using the other words visible in the urxvt window.

For example the terminal looks like this:

It was strongly inspired by `dabbrev` feature in GNU Emacs and later by
[skeleton-complete](https://github.com/baohaojun/skeleton-complete) by Bao
Haojun.

Basic usage
-----------

Just press the key bound to `aAtt:complete` (in the example above:
Alt-Ctrl-slash) to complete the word at point. Subsequent uses cycle through
other possible completions.

Key bound to `aAtt:undo` (Alt-Shift-quote) undoes the completion.

Advanced usage
--------------

For more advanced completions use `aAtt:fuzzy-word-complete`
(Alt-Shift-slash) and `aAtt:skeleton-complete`. It's behavior is inspired by
[skeleton-complete](https://github.com/baohaojun/skeleton-complete), please see
[its readme](http://baohaojun.github.io/skeleton-complete.html) for a more
detailed explanation.

Available functions
-------------------

* `aAtt:word-complete` -- classical prefix-based completion for words
* `aAtt:WORD-complete` -- completion for WORDS (in the Vim meaning)
* `aAtt:fuzzy-word-complete` -- fuzzy completion for words
* `aAtt:fuzzy-WORD-complete` -- fuzzy completion for WORDS
